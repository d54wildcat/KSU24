Optimizing K-State's IT Support Infrastructure: Taking ServiceNow to the Next Level


Good morning, everyone! So today I'm going how we can Modernize Kansas State's IT Support Infrastructure. to share with you a plan on how to make Kansas State University's ServiceNow setup better. We've done some good stuff with what we have now, but truthfully, we've been just getting started. 
It only takes a few strategic upgrades and some better integration for us to really transform IT support from just a basic ticket system into a powerful service platform that actually empowers our academic objectives.
So first a brief overview of the presentation, I will first go over the curent state of IT support here at KSU. I will then go over the Overview of my proposed ServiceNow reimplementation. Then I will go over my proposed targeted upgrades to improve functionality of the current system and to help
with user experience. Then I will highlight some Enhancements for Better Integration and seamless service delivery, and finally I will highlight the goals of the IT Support Transformation.

So first, While our current ServiceNow implementation has provided a foundation for IT support, there are several critical limitations.

1. System Fragmentation
- Different departments are using ServiceNow individually.
• No integrated workflows between departments
- Inconsistent experiences in service delivery

2. Explore Computing Gaps
• Limited Support for special-purpose academic software
- There's no dedicated route for research computing things.
• Complex requests are usually misrouted or delayed

3. Resource Allocation Problems
- Peak periods overwhelming support staff
- Manual ticket assignment causing delays
- Few Self-service facilities

These limitations are especially apparent during critical times, such as semester starts, when our faculty and students need seamless access to resources.
So how can we change this? Well th ere are some enhancements we can implement and here are my Proposed Improvements
We're suggesting some significant overhauling in how we're using ServiceNow in three big areas:

1. Integration and Workflow Enhancement
- Unify isolated ServiceNow instances
Implement automatic routing depending on the type of request
• Facilitate seamless handoffs between support tiers —
3. Tiered Support Model
- Tier 1: General inquiries and common issues
- Tier 2: Technical specialists for complex problems
- Tier 3: Dedicated research computing support 
2. Research Computing Support
• Dedicated research computing support queue
- A knowledge source of research software.
• High-performance computing resources integration
- Priority routing for grant-related requests

3. Service Delivery Optimization
- Enhanced self-service portal
- AI-powered knowledge base recommendations
• Automated escalation paths
- Real-time SLA tracking and alerts

## Implementation Plan 
So we have a conservative improvement plan:

Phase 1: Assessment and Planning - 2 months
- Audit current ServiceNow usage
- Survey user pain points
- Map existing workflows
- Identify integration opportunities

Phase 2: Better Support System (3 months)
- Implement three-tier support model
• Train staff in the new processes
- Develop domain-specific knowledge base
- Configure automated routing

Phase 3: Mixing in Research Computing (3 months)
- Deploy a research computing queue
- Collaborate with school systems
- Build custom forms and workflows
- Train research support specialists

## Expected Benefits 
Based on similar optimizations at other universities, we expect:
- More efficient use of resources
- Better Service Consistency
• More support for the research materials - Decreased resolution times

• Better customer satisfaction

- More proactive issue resolution

## Investment and ROI 

This optimization isn't subject to much additional licensing cost as we already own ServiceNow. 
The real investment is in: - Staff training - Configuration changes - Integration development - Knowledge base creation You'll receive your return on investment by:
 - Reduced manual labor - Better resource allocation - Fewer escalations • Greater research support efficiency 
## Closing 
 We can take academic excellence and research innovation to the next level if we just tweak our ServiceNow setup. 
The basics are in place, so now it is just a matter of making it work its magic. ## Chat & Questions (what's left) 
Sure, I'd be happy to discuss any portion of this optimization plan in greater detail.
